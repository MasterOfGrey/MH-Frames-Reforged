# MH Frames Reforged
Designed for Rimworld 1.4

The main Mechanical Humanlikes modules present Killathon's priorities and focuses.
Where there is room for more niche items not suitable to the design philosophy of Killathon's core mods, this mod is part of a set intended to enable those options for determined players.

## Features
This mod reworks a few existing frames for engineering consistency, tweaks the tech tree and unlock points, and adds a variety of extras.

Also includes code to ensure that the carrying capacity improvements from framework upgrades are applied to weight limits for all purposes including caravans.

### Altered Frames:
* Hydraulic (fixed carrying capacity bonus due to limitations of hydraulic actuators)
* Refined (increased pawn beauty and flat social impact buff from looking nice)
* Mobility (fixed movement speed bonus, again due to actual actuator functioning)

### Added Frames:
* Alignment Frame (hauling frame ideal for trainable mechanical animals)
* Thermal Pumped Frame (combat oriented upgrade to the Guardian Frame)
* Martial Frame (combat durability enhanced upgrade to the Mobility Frame)
* Advanced Alignment Frame (improved from above but spacer tech and much more expensive)
* Advanced Hydraulic Frame (as above; same scope of improvements and tech/cost changes)
* Noble Frame (more refined version of the Refined Frame with a focus on enhancing Nobility)

I am happy to add other unique frames if people want them.

## Recommended:
* Works best with MH Industrial Automatons!

## Compatibility:
* Requires MH: Android Tiers Core
* Safe to add to a save game, make sure there are no existing jobs or frames to remove it.
* No known incompatibilities - it'll just do nothing without MH:ATC.

## Questions
> **Can this be patched to work with <insert mod>?**

If you make a patch, I'll happily add it in. I may make patches if they're easy, but I won't be doing any messy patches myself though.

> **Will you add the other localisations for other languages like ATR has?**

As above, if you would like to provide a localisation, I'll happily add it in.
